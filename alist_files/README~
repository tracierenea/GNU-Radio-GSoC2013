Filename convention: 

H_<n>_<column weight>_<row weight>_<description>.alist

where: 

n = number of columns in the matrix, also the codeword length
column weight = original column weight
row weight = original row weight

description:

original = original, regular, matrix generated by LDPC_parity_check_matrix.regular_LDPC_code_constructor

full_rank = The original matrix was reduced to a full rank version using getFullRankHmatrix. This matrix is no longer regular (i.e. not all columns have the same weight).

encoding-ready = the full_rank matrix was processed by getParametersForEncoding and produced this matrix, which is suitable for use during real-time encoding.
